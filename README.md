# Arduino
The code which counts the number of buttons pushed was only tested on Arduini Uno (clone) with 1 digit 7 segment display (with dot)
with common anode (+).
Please note the pin connections.
The file 1_digit segment_hex.xlsx contans the pin mapping to the leds and also decimal to binary and to hex which are used in my code.
