This is code for showing the number of pushed from 0 to 9 (because 1 digit 7 segment display)
You can also view the count using the monitor of Serial output of 9600.
Note: the code is for common adnode (+).
The code for common catode will be different even though not too much.
In common anode Led is On when pin output is LOW, and the pin is OFF when the pin output is HIGH.
Do not forget to use 200-330 Om resistors on Leds and 10 kOm resistor on button. Be safe!

 VCC 5V     Resistor 10kOm connected to ground
 The connection to the ground is needed to avoid the following problems:
 - buzzing of the button;
 - to make sure it does not any static and it is set to 0 when it does not any current (from 5v)
